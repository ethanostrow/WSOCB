AP English 75/77 with Ms. Moffitt Thought Piece Creative Alternative

y idea was to create a website for a fictional group based on The Case for Reparations, "Whites for the Oppression and Segregation of Chicago Blacks". On this website, under a tab called "Partners", I plan on describing the Chicago Real Estate Board and the FHA's role in perpetuating systemic racism. Under "Mission", I'll describe the group's purpose to enrich its members and subjugate black residents of Chicago, while under "Ongoing Campaigns" I'll talk about block-busting, restrictive covenants, and violence against black homeowners in Chicago. I'll probably add at least two more pages in addition to those already described. I plan on being very detailed and reading between the lines of the article in order to create an engaging and ironic spin-off.
